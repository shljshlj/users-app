This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

To serve the data for the app, first install [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

`npm install -g json-server`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn run json:server`,
Serves the data

`json-server data/generate.js`
or generate your own data.

Both scripts make the data available at [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004).

`yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
App is ready to be deployed!
